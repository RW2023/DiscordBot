# ***Discord Bot Project***

This project is a basic Discord bot created using the 'discord.js' module. The bot responds to commands that users type in the chat and performs various actions.

## Features to be implemented

- Responds to a '!hello' command by sending a greeting message in the chat.
- Responds to the ‘!timzone’ command by replying with an interface to choose appropriate timzones. Roles will be appended to user if the role exists. If the role does not exist create it and append it to the user.
- Responds to the ‘!project’ command by Sending user to the correct workflow for obtaining the project role and the default channel list. (Basically automate whatever process needs automating but those would be the first to tackle)
